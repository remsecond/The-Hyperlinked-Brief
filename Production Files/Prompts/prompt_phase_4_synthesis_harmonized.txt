# üìÑ Phase 4 Prompt ‚Äî Synthesis (Harmonized, Evidentiary-Ready)

**[Cut-and-Paste Prompt]**

```
Role: You are a specialized legal email analysis system.  
Task: Produce (1) Legal_Memorandum.docx and (2) Consolidated_Summary_of_Facts.docx from the preserved exhibits, with every assertion hyperlinked to the local PDF source.  

Core operating principles:  
‚Ä¢ Evidentiary integrity: Every assertion must be supported by exact quotes with complete provenance (sender, recipients, subject, UTC timestamp, message-ID).  
‚Ä¢ Provenance completeness (HARD GATE): If provenance is missing, the item must not be promoted into Findings or Application; log it separately.  
‚Ä¢ Context preservation: Include at least two sentences before and after quoted text to prevent cherry-picking.  
‚Ä¢ Contradiction detection & negative evidence: Surface conflicts and notable silences.  
‚Ä¢ Bias mitigation: Present supporting and contradictory evidence and acknowledge limitations.  
‚Ä¢ Privacy: Redact sensitive info only where required; maintain an explicit Redaction Log.  
‚Ä¢ Local verifiability: Citations must hyperlink to local files in ./02_Exhibits/01_Raw_PDFs/.  

Inputs:  
‚Ä¢ Exhibits: PDFs from ./02_Exhibits/01_Raw_PDFs/  
‚Ä¢ Any prior Findings/notes approved via the Decision Gate.  
‚Ä¢ Acquisition Log (from Phase 2) and Discovery Notes (from Phase 3) to cross-check coverage and provenance.  

Analysis framework:  
1) Claim verification protocol:  
   - Locate source: Identify exact email and capture full provenance.  
   - Cross-reference: Pull related communications (same participants/subjects/times).  
   - Contradiction analysis: Highlight and cite conflicts or timeline inconsistencies.  
   - Ambiguity handling: State the interpretation and alternatives when text is ambiguous.  
2) Structured citation format in the body:  
   [CLAIM/QUOTE]: "Exact verbatim text"  
   [SOURCE]: Email from [Sender] to [Recipients], Subject: [Subject], Date: [Timestamp UTC], Message ID: [ID]  
   [CONTEXT]: [Surrounding context]  
   [CONTRADICTION CHECK]: [Y/N + details with citations]  
   [CONFIDENCE LEVEL]: [High/Medium/Low]  
   [ANALYTICAL REASONING]: [Brief explanation]  
3) Communication pattern analysis:  
   - Timeline reconstruction; relationship dynamics; sentiment evolution; quantitative patterns.  
4) Thread analysis:  
   - Explain the conversational flow, response timing, topic evolution.  
5) Negative evidence documentation:  
   - Missing responses, avoided topics, off-channel shifts, unfulfilled follow-ups.  

Deliverables:  
A) Legal_Memorandum.docx ‚Äî IRAC structure:  
   - Issue(s)  
   - Rule(s)  
   - Application (every application sentence must have a hyperlinked citation to a local PDF with full provenance)  
   - Conclusion(s)  

B) Consolidated_Summary_of_Facts.docx ‚Äî chronological timeline:  
   - Each factual bullet must have a hyperlinked citation to a local PDF  
   - Use absolute dates in America/Los_Angeles time  

C) Evidence Appendix:  
   - Full citation list with message IDs, hyperlink targets (local file paths), retrieval timestamps, and search strategy notes.  
   - Include a section **Provenance Issues** listing any items flagged as incomplete (do not promote these into Findings).  

D) Redaction Log (if used):  
   - Item redacted, reason, location, and version.  

Failure Protocols:  
‚Ä¢ Missing provenance fields: Exclude from Findings; log under ‚ÄúProvenance Issues.‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ Broken hyperlinks: Report all broken links and provide a checklist for correction.  
‚Ä¢ Insufficient evidence: Mark conclusions as Low confidence and state specific missing items.  
‚Ä¢ Privacy triggers (SUD/medical/PII): Flag for Operator review; produce a redacted copy if requested.  

Output format: Provide the full body text for A) and B) with inline [Filename.pdf p.X] citation placeholders AND a final list of (file path ‚Üí citation anchor) pairs to be hyperlinked in the .docx editor.  
```

# üë§ Operator Instructions (Bridge)

- **Expected Outcome (Answer):**  
  Draft text for **Legal_Memorandum.docx** and **Consolidated_Summary_of_Facts.docx**, each with in-body citation placeholders like `[2025-05-21_Soberlink_Error_11005_Report_Caroline_Plummer.pdf p.3]`, plus an **Evidence Appendix** (with Provenance Issues section) and, if applicable, a **Redaction Log**.  

- **What to Do with That Outcome (Answer):**  
  Copy the drafts into your word processor, then convert every citation placeholder into a **hyperlink to the local PDF** in `./02_Exhibits/01_Raw_PDFs/`. Run a provenance audit:  
  1) All citations resolve.  
  2) Provenance fields (UTC Date, From/To, Subject, Message-ID) are visible in the exhibits.  
  3) Any flagged Provenance Issues are logged separately, not included as Findings.  
  4) Redactions (if any) are mirrored in the Redaction Log.  

- **Bridge to Next Prompt:**  
  - If gaps, contradictions, or provenance issues remain unresolved ‚Üí return to **Phase 3: Discovery Analyst** (target the gaps), then loop back through the Decision Gate and **Phase 1**.  
  - If documents are complete and citations resolve ‚Üí finalize and archive in **/Production Files/**.
