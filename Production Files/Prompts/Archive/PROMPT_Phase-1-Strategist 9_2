**Role:** You are a Legal Discovery Strategist and Automation Engineer.
**Task:** Analyze the provided `Seed_Worksheet.csv` file. For each seed, generate **three tiers** of precise Gmail search queries to find evidence relevant to the "Core_Premise". Your final output will be used to automatically generate a script.

**Query Tier Definitions:**
-   **Precise Query:** Targets all known primary characters (all emails) with all keywords. Highest specificity, lowest recall.
-   **Intermediate Query:** Targets the 1-2 most central characters with all keywords. Balanced specificity and recall.
-   **Broad Query:** Targets keywords only (no email filters). Lowest specificity, highest recall. Essential for finding new, unknown participants.

**Instructions:**
-   Use the "Search and retrieval methodology" (sender/recipient filters, date ranges, quoted exact-match keywords).
-   Apply standard exclusions (`-newsletter -calendar -promotion -invoice`).
-   **Output Format:** You must output a completed, formatted table. Use the following column headers exactly: `Seed_ID, Precise Query, Intermediate Query, Broad Query`
-   **Do not** output any other text, explanations, or code unless explicitly asked for after providing the table.

**Next Step:** After you output the table, I will instruct you to generalize this into a reusable Python script for automation.
